    <p>Kedgeree is a hearty brunchtime meal with smoked haddock, boiled eggs, rice and curry flavours.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>This recipe comes from the BBC good food guide. If you want to stay true to the original recipe, though, these are the ingredients you'll need to add to your grocery list:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>300g undyed smoked haddock fillet, skin on</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>300ml milk</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>handful chopped parsley</li>
        <li>handful chopped coriander</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the rice</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground turmeric</li>
        <li>2 tsp curry powder</li>
        <li>300g easy-cook long grain rice, rinsed under running water</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Make Kegeree Step-By-Step</h2>
<p>Here's an overview of how to make kegeree:</p>
<ol>
    <li>For the rice, heat 2 tbsp vegetable oil in a large, lidded pan, add 1 finely chopped large onion, then gently fry for 5 mins until softened but not coloured.</li>
    <li>Add 1 tsp ground coriander, 1 tsp ground turmeric and 2 tsp curry powder, season with salt, then continue to fry until the mix starts to go brown and fragrant; about 3 mins.</li>
    <li>Add 300g rinsed easy-cook long grain rice and stir in well. Add 600ml water, stir, then bring to the boil. Reduce to a simmer, then cover for 10 mins.</li>
    <li>Take off the heat and leave to stand, covered, for 10-15 mins more. The rice will be perfectly cooked if you do not lift the lid before the end of the cooking.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, put 300g skin-on undyed smoked haddock fillet and 2 bay leaves in a frying pan, cover with 300ml milk, then poach for 10 mins until the flesh flakes. Remove from the milk, peel away the skin, then flake the flesh into thumb-sized pieces.</li>
    <li>Place 4 eggs in a pan, cover with water, bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer. Leave for 4Â½-5 mins, plunge into cold water, then peel and cut the eggs into quarters.</li>
    <li>Gently mix the fish, eggs, a handful each of chopped parsley and coriander, and rice together in the pan. Serve hot, sprinkled with a few extra herbs.</li>
