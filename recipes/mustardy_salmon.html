<h2>How to Make Mustardy salmon Step-By-Step</h2>
<p>Here's how to make Mustardy salmon:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Mix together 1 tbsp oil, the mustard, honey and some seasoning. Put the salmon fillets on a baking tray and spread the honey and mustard mixture all over. Tip the lentils and beetroot into a casserole dish, toss with the remaining oil and season well. Put both in the oven for 10 mins until the salmon is cooked through.</li>
    <li>Stir the crème fraîche, dill, capers and lemon zest through the lentils. Serve alongside the salmon with the pumpkin seeds scattered over and lemon wedges for squeezing, with a rocket salad on the side, if you like.</li>
